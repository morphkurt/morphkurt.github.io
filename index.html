# FTTH with Dial-Up Speeds

## Background

As a new home owner, I was glad and proud to say that I have fiber at home. No more ADSL speeds, lighting fast internet and no more buffering on the videos. Yep I got a first world problem. All my problems started after I moved to iiNet after I fell for the unmetered Netflix marketing trick. My Internet speeds has horrible. Whenever I tried to complain to iiNet I have been struggling prove that my internet is really slow. I have been bounced around many times.

This page is created to prove my internet speeds at home
